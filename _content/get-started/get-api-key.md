### About this task#

Log in to the Watson Assistant console to access your Waston Assistant instance.  From the console, you can:
- Manage your skills and skillsets.
- Manage your clients.
- Converse with your skills using a chat interface.
- View your Watson Assistant logs.
- Access the Swagger speficiations for your Watson Assistant REST APIs.<br>

To log in to the console, you must either provide your Watson Assistant API key or your IBMid.</p>

**Using your API key**:
<br>Your Watson Assistant API key is sent to you in the Welcome Letter.  It is your unique key in the format of <br>```xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx```<br> The key uniquely identifies your developer organization. Store your key in an environment variable or environment files and use it when you make API calls to the service.  For an example of how to use the API key, see the *Creating a simple skill* tutorial.</p><p>**Note**: Your Watson Assistant might make calls to other services on IBM Cloud or 3rd party services.  These services will have their own API keys.  As an application developer, you must provision and manage these keys.</p>
**Using your IBMid**:
<br>To log in using your IBMid, you must link your IBMid to your Watson Assistant API key.  For instructions, see [Linking your Watson Assistant API key with your your IBMid]({{site.baseurl}}/get-started/get-api-key/).
