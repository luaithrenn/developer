The Watson Assistant Solution is a framework for building personal assistants that automate tasks or answer questions in response to natural language input from a user.  Using the framework, you can build your assistant to have multiple skills.  

A skill is a capability in a specific domain, for example, making restaurant reservations or answering general knowledge questions.  Skills are developed by using natural language understanding (NLU) engines, such as the IBM Watson Conversation service on IBM Cloud, to understand natural-language input and to respond in a way that simulates human conversation.

Using the Watson Assistant Solution framework, you can choose from the pre-built skills or you can create your own custom skills.  When a user asks assistant a question or gives a command, either by voice or by text, the Watson Assistant application determines the best skill to send the request and routes the input to that skill for processing.  A response is returned to the user or an action is performed.
