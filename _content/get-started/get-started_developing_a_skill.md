Skills are...

Each skill is composed of intents, entities, and dialogs.

*Intents:  You define an intent for each type of user request you want your assistant to support.  For example, you might define an intent to turn off something in your car.
*Entities:  An object or date type that is relevant to your intents and provides specific context for the intent.  For example, your intent is to turn off something.  You might define an entity in your skill for radio or the air conditioner.
*Dialog:  The flow of conversation that determines how your assistant responds based on the intents and entities in receives from the user.
